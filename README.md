# DCIS-model
Here is the code for my Ducta Carcinoma In Situ model that I(Meera Gupta) worked on during ASSIP 2020. Thanks to Dr. Lance Liotta and Ms. Marissa Howard (George Mason University, Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine) for their mentorship. 

The Cells class is used by both the stable duct lining model and the aggressive DCIS model.

The DCIS.pde file is a preliminary model for how a tumor might develop from the duct lining, StableDuctLining models a regular duct lining.
